      <!-- Professional Summary -->
      <section id="summary">
        <p id="first-paragraph">
          I have over time worked myself into the position of senior controller,
          managing a team of 3 colleagues, while working with multiple other
          staff levels on a moment-to-moment basis at a national scale,
          coordinating and setting shifts, calculating working hours and leave
          days, and trying to ensure the business operates as best it can.
        </p>

        <p id="second-paragraph">
          I am comfortable on the phone, can convey messages and information
          across needed, as well as managing breakdowns to ensure that all are
          attended to in a timely matter, keeping clients updated and informed.
          I also have experience as an assistant manager at NuMetro managing a
          team of 30 staff members.
        </p>

        <p>
          My comfort with technology has allowed me to keep up with increasing
          work demands, and I am looking to expand my skillset into development
          for further value propositions to employers. I have achieved a
          bachelors degree in business and marketing, and also have a higher
          certificate in pc engineering, but currently I am studying Coding
          through HyperionDev (<i>FullStack developer and Web development</i>).
          I am self-driven, loyal and motivated to learn new skills and take on
          new responsibilities.
